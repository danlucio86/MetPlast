# MetPlast
MetPlast is an R-package that integrates functions that allows to calculate several parameters associated with Metabolic Plasticity using Shannon entropy from Information Theory as an statistical framework.

MetPlast consolidates some of the latest research in Plant Computational Metabolomics, providing valuable computational tools to quickly evaluate several parameters such as metabolic diversity,  specialization, and metabolite specialization, as well as statistical measurements. 

MetPlast is being continuosly updated. Thus, new functionalities will be added soon. Please, take into account that even though this package was settle using metabolomic data, the same functions can be use to evaluate transcriptomic data.

A comprehensive tutorial can be found in the main coding page at GitHub in three independent formats: (1) Rmd, (2) .html, (3) .pdf. It can also be read using browseVignettes("MetPlast")
